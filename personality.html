    <!-- Introduction Statement -->
    <div class="intro">
        <p><strong> Here, I showcase the impact of my strongest traits and hobbies on my academic life, 
		share a meaningful quote, and provide insights from a personality test that reflects who I am.</strong></p>
    </div>

    <!-- Strongest Trait and Hobby -->
    <div class="section-container">
        <div class="section-item">
            <h2>Strongest Trait and Hobby</h2>
            <img src="../Assets/strongest-trait.jpg" alt="Strongest Trait Image">
            <p>My strongest trait is my determination for success. It fuels my persistence in overcoming academic challenges. It helps me to maintain focus on 
            long-term goals, such as mastering complex topics or achieving high grades. This mindset encourages me to consistently put in the effort to complete 
            assignments on time, attend classes, and actively participate in discussions. Even when faced with setbacks, my determination motivates me to find solutions 
            and keep pushing forward, improving my problem-solving skills and resilience. My strongest hobby is crochet. While crochet may seem unrelated to academics 
            at first glance, it provides a creative outlet that enhances my ability to focus and de-stress. Engaging in crochet improves fine motor skills, 
            patience, and concentration—qualities that are valuable in my academic life, especially during periods of intense study. 
            Crochet also allows me to relax and reset mentally, helping me to return to my studies with a fresh perspective and renewed energy. 
            This balance between work and hobby ensures that I stay productive while maintaining my well-being.</p>

    <!-- Favorite Quote -->
    <div class="quote-container">
        <h2>Favorite Quote</h2>
        <p>“It always seems impossible until it’s done.” - Nelson Mandela</p>
        <img src="../Assets/quote-image.jpg" alt="Quote Image">
         <p>I chose Nelson Mandela as my hero because of his unwavering commitment to justice, equality, and peace. 
        His life and struggles against apartheid in South Africa exemplify resilience, determination, and an incredible sense of purpose. 
        Despite being imprisoned for 27 years, Mandela never gave up on his vision of a free and equal society, and this strength in the face of adversity inspires me greatly.
        I admire how he approached challenges with calm determination and the belief that change, no matter how impossible it may seem, is achievable if you persist. 
        This resonates deeply with my personal values and my own determination to succeed in my academic and personal life. Mandela’s legacy serves as a 
        powerful reminder to remain steadfast, even when the path is difficult, and to work towards a higher purpose with courage and conviction.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Personality Test Results -->
    <div class="personality-test-container">
        <h2>Personality Test Results</h2>
        <img src="../Assets/personality-test.png" alt="Personality Test Results">
        <p>In general, this personality test has a level of validity. This test aims to highlight common behavioral patterns and preferences, 
        which can be useful for understanding how someone approaches relationships, work, and problem-solving. For me specifically, 
        the Guardian personality resonates with me in terms of my strong sense of responsibility, reliability, and focus on security and structure. 
        Given my determination for success and organized approach to academic and career goals, this type aligns with my personal traits.</p>
