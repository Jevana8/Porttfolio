    Here, I explore my journey of growth through academic challenges, personal experiences, and reflections. 
    As a student of Computer Science, I'm constantly developing skills not only in technical areas but also in how I approach life, work, and relationships. 
    This page showcases how key readings, like <em>"Twelve Pillars"</em>, have influenced my outlook on life and how I apply the principles I’ve learned to both my academic and personal journeys.

<p class="centered-paragraphs">
    Join me as I reflect on lessons learned, showcase my top skills, and outline the steps I’m taking to become the best version of myself, both professionally and personally.

        <h2>Reflection on "Twelve Pillars" Chapters 4-7</h2>
        <img src="twelvepillars.jpg" alt="Twelve Pillars Book" class="image-right"> <!-- Add your image path -->
		<p> <strong>Chapter 4: </strong> </p> 
        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Michael talks about how he used the metaphor of gardening to improve his relationship with Amy. 
		He said that regular effort, such as weekly outings, helped to nurture their bond. The topic of Michael's frustrations with his career comes up, 
		and he acknowledges that he feels unfulfilled and unmotivated. Charlie, quoting Mr. Davis as counsel, emphasizes the significance of goal-setting and 
		putting it in writing. By doing so, he explains, the mind is able to focus on achieving concrete objectives rather than abstract concepts. He presents the idea of 
		long-term, mid-range, and short-term goals, decomposing lofty objectives into more manageable chunks. 
		Charlie highlights that achieving the objective is not the only aspect of success; it also involves personal 
		development during the process. Michael is urged to act by him, as he reminds him that although change takes time, 
		making small initial changes and changing course can eventually result in advancement and achievement.</p>
        
		<p> <strong>Chapter 5: </strong> </p> 
		<p><strong>Summary:</strong> Michael laments that he doesn't have enough time for his personal aspirations because of his demanding job and family obligations. 
		Mr. Davis once said, "We must all suffer from one of two pains: the pain of discipline or the pain of regret." 
		Charlie answers with a quote from him. Michael is urged by him to understand that regrets are heavier in the long run and that discipline 
		and meaningful goals should be the top priorities. Charlie emphasizes that life is brief and valuable and that living each day to the fullest—in 
		line with one's overarching objectives—avoids the weight of regret in the future. He warns Michael not to make the mistake of focusing more on what 
		is urgent than what is important, pointing out that most people become bogged down in daily activities that don't bring lasting satisfaction. 
		Charlie stresses the value of creating a life plan and living intentionally rather than letting other people's circumstances control it. Michael thanks 
		Charlie for the advice and says they will speak again soon as his pager goes off, forcing him back to work, even though it's obvious he still needs to improve 
		his time management and priority-setting skills.</p>
		
		<p> <strong>Chapter 6: </strong> </p> 
		<p><strong>Summary:</strong> Charlie suggests that Michael assess the influence of his friendships on his development as a person. 
		He clarifies that associations can be positive, neutral, or negative and offers the classification of relationships according to their influence 
		into disassociation, limited association, and expanded association. Charlie stresses the value of surrounding oneself with positive people instead of 
		negative people who perpetuate negativity in order to inspire success and personal growth. Michael should concentrate on bettering himself, he says, since 
		success in the pursuit of success will inevitably draw success in others. Charlie concludes by emphasizing the importance of having a positive 
		influence and attitude in order to succeed both personally and professionally. </p>
		
		<p> <strong>Chapter 7: </strong> </p> 
		<p><strong>Summary:</strong> Charlie highlights the value of self-education over formal education in this passage, citing Mr. Davis's assertion that 
		"self-education will make you a fortune." In order to promote growth, he advises Michael to read books, watch successful people, 
		and think back on past experiences. Charlie emphasizes the transformational potential of reading despite Michael's initial resistance, 
		providing Michael with The Magic of Thinking Big as a starting point and a list of suggested books. Michael, who lost his father when he was young, 
		feels that Charlie's warmth, insight, and mentoring fill a void, and he starts to accept the idea of success and personal development. </p>
		
		
        <p><strong>Reflection:</strong> To apply the lessons from these chapters to my life, I must start by evaluating my associations. 
		I should surround myself with people who inspire and challenge me limiting time with those who hold me back. I should also pursue self-education beyond formal 
		schooling by dedicating time to read, observe successful individuals, and reflect on my experiences. 
		In addition I should challenge any negative beliefs that hinder my growth, like avoiding new learning opportunities, and push myself to engage in activities that foster 
		development. Finally, I should embrace the mindset of "thinking big" by setting ambitious goals and taking bold steps toward achieving them. 
		These actions will help me unlock my full potential and move toward success.</p>
        <p>The ideas of persistence, patience, and surrounding myself with supportive people are elements I can already see helping me navigate challenges in my academic journey, building towards my career aspirations.</p>
